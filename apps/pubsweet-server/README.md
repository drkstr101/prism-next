# pubsweet-server

Launches a pubsweet compatible server using express. The server documentation can be found [here](https://dev.coko.foundation/?path=/docs/common-libraries-server--page).

## Getting Started

The internal pubsweet migrations must be run before launching the server. Run `yarn pubsweet migrate` to initiate the database migration. This will be done automatically when not running in production.
